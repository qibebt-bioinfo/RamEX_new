\title{Detect outliers in a dataset based on distance from the mean spectrum}
\usage{
Qualitycontrol.Dis(x, min.dis = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A matrix of spectral data where each row represents a single spectrum.}

\item{min.dis}{The minimum distance threshold for marking a spectrum as an outlier.
Defaults to 1.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing two columns: 'out' indicating whether each spectrum is an
        outlier, and 'dis' containing the corresponding distance values.
}
\description{
This function identifies outliers in a dataset by calculating the distance of each spectrum
from the mean spectrum of non-outlier spectra. The distance is calculated as the square
root of the sum of the squared differences between each spectrum and the mean spectrum.
Spectra with a distance greater than a specified threshold are marked as outliers.

\examples{
# Create sample spectral data
set.seed(123)
wavenumbers <- seq(500, 3500, length.out=100)
spectra <- matrix(rnorm(3000), nrow=30)
