\title{Perform Louvain Clustering on Spectral Data}
\usage{
Phenotype.Analysis.Louvaincluster(
  object,
  resolutions,
  npc = 10,
  threshold = 0.001,
  k = 30,
  n_tree = 50
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A Ramanome object containing the spectral data.}

\item{resolutions}{A vector of resolutions at which to perform the Louvain clustering.}

\item{npc}{The number of principal components to retain in the PCA. Defaults to 10.}

\item{threshold}{The minimum number of samples required to consider a cluster valid.
Defaults to 0.001.}

\item{k}{The number of nearest neighbors to consider. Defaults to 30.}

\item{n_tree}{The number of trees to use in the Approximate Nearest Neighbor search.
Defaults to 50.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the cluster assignments for each resolution.
}
\description{
This function performs Louvain clustering on the spectral data stored in a Ramanome
object. It first reduces the dimensionality of the data using PCA, then calculates
the k-nearest neighbors for each point, and finally applies the Louvain algorithm
to detect communities at different resolutions.
