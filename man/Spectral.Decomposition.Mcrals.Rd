\title{Perform Multivariate Curve Resolution Alternating Least Squares (MCR-ALS)}
\usage{
Spectral.Decomposition.Mcrals(object, ncomp)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A Ramanome object containing the dataset.}

\item{ncomp}{The number of components to estimate.}
}
\value{
A list containing the estimated components and concentrations.
}
\description{
This function applies the MCR-ALS algorithm to the dataset stored in a Ramanome object.
MCR-ALS is a chemometric technique used to resolve overlapping spectra into their
constituent pure components. The function returns the estimated components and
concentrations.

\examples{
# Create sample spectral data
wavenumbers <- seq(500, 3500, by = 10)
n_samples <- 100
n_waves <- length(wavenumbers)
